## 4️⃣ Document Review (⭐ NEW FEATURE!)

### Understanding Document Review

**What Changed**: You can now approve/reject **individual documents** instead of waiting for all documents to be perfect.

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Faster processing
- ✅ Clear feedback to applicants
- ✅ Reduced back-and-forth
- ✅ Applicants know exactly what's wrong

### How to Review Documents

1. **Open Application** you're processing
2. **Navigate to Documents Tab**
3. **Click "Submitted" sub-tab**
4. You'll see list of uploaded documents with:
   - Document type
   - File name
   - Upload date
   - Current status (Pending / Approved / Rejected)

### Reviewing Individual Documents

For each document:

1. **Click the arrow icon** (▶️) next to document name
2. **Document Review Modal Opens** showing:
   - Document preview (if image/PDF)
   - Document details
   - Action buttons

3. **Examine the Document**:

   **✅ Good Document Checklist**:
   - Clear and readable
   - Complete (all pages present)
   - Correct document type
   - Valid/Not expired
   - Matches applicant information
   - Official/original (not obviously fake)

   **❌ Reject If**:
   - Blurry or illegible
   - Wrong document uploaded
   - Expired (check dates!)
   - Missing pages
   - Appears altered/fake
   - Low quality scan

4. **Take Action**:

   **To Approve ✅**:
   - Click **"Approve"** button
   - Document status changes to "Approved"
   - Green checkmark appears
   - Applicant receives notification: "Your [document name] has been approved"

   **To Reject ❌**:
   - Click **"Reject"** button
   - **Rejection reason text area appears**
   - **IMPORTANT**: Provide specific, helpful reason:
  
   **Good Rejection Reasons**:
   ```
   "Image is too blurry to read the ID number. Please re-take photo in better lighting."
   
   "This appears to be a water bill, but we need electricity bill for proof of address."
   
   "Certificate has expired (valid until Dec 2025). Please provide current 2026 certificate."
   
   "Only page 1 is uploaded. Please combine all 3 pages into single PDF."
   ```
   
   **Bad Rejection Reasons** (Don't do this!):
   ```
   "Not clear" - Be specific about what's unclear
   "Wrong document" - Specify what's needed
   "Rejected" - Always explain why!
   ```

   - Click **"Confirm Rejection"**
   - Applicant receives notification with your reason
   - They can re-upload corrected document

### Document Review Best Practices

**✅ DO**:
- Review documents same day they're uploaded
- Be specific in rejection reasons

- Check expiry dates carefully
- Zoom in if image is small

**❌ DON'T**:
- Leave documents pending for days

- Be unnecessarily strict on minor issues
- Approve obviously fake documents

### Handling Re-Submissions

When applicant re-uploads after rejection:

1. Document shows as**"Pending"** again
2. You review it fresh
3. Check if they fixed the issue you mentioned
4. If fixed → Approve ✅
5. If still issues → Reject again with updated feedback

it and we need a few additional documents to proceed..."

requires forthwith the provision of documentation as per..."

```
